## About Me

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Information Engineering, supervised by Prof. [Yuchao Dai](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fddAbqsAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) in [NPU-CVR](http://npu-cvr.cn/) (website in Chinese) lab at Northwestern Polytechnical University ([NPU](http://en.nwpu.edu.cn/)), Xi'an, China.

Before that, I received B.E. degree in Software Engineering at NPU in 2024, during which I participated in several student competitions and received the Outstanding Undergraduate Student awards. 

My research lies at the intersection of **3D Vision** and **Low-Level Vision**. My research interests include novel view synthesis, image super-resolution, object detection, etc.
